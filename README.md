# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide project was created with the intention to serve as reference to the basics
of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and GIT. One of the challenges many new developers face is the amount of information
they are introduced to and the steep learning curve. By having a lot of the basic information regarding
these technologies all in one study guide, they will be able to quickly reference it throughout their 
student and professional career.
